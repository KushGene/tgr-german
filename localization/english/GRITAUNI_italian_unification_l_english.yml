  ########################### ITALIAN UNIFICATION: JE  #######################################  
  je_emilian_trade_league: "The Emilian Trade League"
  je_emilian_trade_league_status: "Emilian duchies are supporting the unification. If we unify our market with theirs, we will be able to create an integrated economic and political entity."
  je_emilian_trade_league_reason: "During the era of Italian unification, the Duchies of Modena, Parma, and Lucca found themselves in a complex position. Ruled by different monarchs, these territories experienced varying degrees of unrest and political intrigue.\n\nThe Duchy of Modena, under the reign of the House of Este, faced internal dissent as calls for unification grew louder. Parma, governed by the House of Bourbon, also grappled with internal strife and external pressures to align with the broader Italian nationalist movements. Lucca, a smaller duchy, faced similar challenges under the rule of Elisa Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister.\n\nThe people of these duchies harbored aspirations of independence and unity, yearning to be part of a cohesive Italian nation. As tensions mounted and revolutionary sentiments spread, the duchies found themselves on the brink of significant political transformations that would shape their destinies and the course of Italian unification."

  je_tuscan_alliance: "The Piedmont-Tuscan Alliance"
  je_tuscan_alliance_status: "Tuscany is a valid ally for our unification goals. If we strengthen our relationship, we should be able to sign a treaty of mutual military cooperation."
  je_tuscan_alliance_reason: "Before Italian unification, Tuscany was the independent Grand Duchy of Tuscany, ruled by the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty since 1737. It was a prosperous region with Florence as its cultural capital. After a brief Napoleonic interruption (1801-1814), it was restored at the Congress of Vienna.\n\nUnder Grand Duke Leopold II, Tuscany experienced relative liberalism and progress, but nationalist sentiments grew in the 1840s. The 1848 revolutions led to a constitution, though Leopold II later fled and returned with Austrian support, implementing conservative policies. By 1859, during the Second Italian War of Independence, Tuscan sentiment favored unification. Leopold II abdicated in April, and in 1860, Tuscany voted to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, becoming part of the newly unified Italy."
  
  je_two_sicilies_campaign: "The Expedition of the Thousand"
  je_two_sicilies_campaign_status: "We cannot intervene directly in the Bourbons' territories, but we can finance the rebels' activities to push the government of Two Sicilies to fall."
  je_two_sicilies_campaign_reason: "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies faced tumultuous times during the period leading up to the Expedition of the Thousand. The Kingdom, created in 1816 after the Congress of Vienna, encompassed the regions of Naples and Sicily, each with its unique challenges and societal structures.\n\nAs tensions rose in the mid-19th century with the fervor of Italian unification spreading, the rulers of Two Sicilies struggled to maintain control amidst growing calls for independence and self-determination. The people's dissatisfaction with the ruling monarchy and desire for a unified Italy fueled revolutionary movements and plots, setting the stage for the momentous events that would unfold with the arrival of Garibaldi and his Thousand.\n\nThe Kingdom of Two Sicilies stood at a crossroads, its fate intertwined with the larger Italian unification movement that would reshape the political landscape of the peninsula forever."

  je_papal_state_campaign: "The War of the Pope"
  je_papal_state_campaign_status: "The Papal government cannot stand anymore against unification. If we ensure that the great powers will not intervene, we will be able to start the conquest of the Papal States."
  je_papal_state_campaign_reason: "The Papal States were territories in central Italy under direct sovereign rule of the Pope. In the early 19th century, the Papal States faced significant challenges. The Napoleonic Wars led to French occupation and temporary abolition of papal rule. After Napoleon's defeat, the Congress of Vienna restored the Papal States in 1815. However, growing nationalist sentiments and demands for unification with other Italian states led to increasing tensions.\n\nThe Pope resisted these pressures, viewing them as threats to his temporal power, but in the following years, the Papal States became increasingly isolated as the movement for Italian unification gained momentum. By 1860, much of the Papal territory had been annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia, leaving only Rome and its surrounding areas under papal control. This remnant would persist until 1870, when Rome finally fell to Italian forces, completing the unification process."

  je_austria_hungary_campaign: "The Reclamation of Lombardy-Venetia"
  je_austria_hungary_campaign_status: "The Italian dream became realized, but there are still some territories under foreign control. It's time to assert our claim on those lands against Austria."
  je_austria_hungary_campaign_reason: "During the process of Italian unification, the conquest of Lombardy-Venetia was a crucial step. In 1859, the Kingdom of Sardinia, led by Victor Emmanuel II and supported by an alliance with Napoleon III's France, launched the Second War of Independence against the Austrian Empire, which controlled the region.\n\nAfter victories at the battles of Magenta and Solferino, Austria was forced to cede Lombardy to France, which then handed it over to the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1866, during the Third War of Independence, Italy allied with Prussia, which was at war with Austria. Despite Italian defeats at Custoza and Lissa, Prussia’s victory compelled Austria to cede Venetia to the Kingdom of Italy through French mediation.\n\nWith the annexation of Lombardy-Venetia, Italy took a decisive step towards unification, laying the foundation for a finally independent and united country."

  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_5: "The Expedition of the Thousand"
  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_5_desc: "The Bourbon government has long remained anchored to the old restorationist glories. Their political inaction has led to a total paralysis of the Italian peninsula. If we want to reunify Italy, we must ensure that the masses of the kingdom rebel against their own masters. We will finance the activities of the rebels, in order to bring down the Bourbon government."

  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_6: "Spur Pro-Unification Sentiment"
  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_6_desc: "We shall finance the activities of the rebels to generate agitation in the peninsula. Every effort is critical to achieving our goal, and we will not stop until the Savoy flag flies over Naples."

  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_7: "The War of the Pope"
  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_7_desc: "The Papal States stand as a formidable barrier to Italian unification, clinging to power while stifling the aspirations of the people. The Pope’s influence over temporal matters has long thwarted the dreams of a unified nation. To dismantle this ecclesiastical stronghold, we must rally patriots and ignite a fervent campaign against clerical authority. With adequate resources and unwavering support, we can empower the insurgents, spreading dissent throughout the territories under Papal control. This uprising will force the Papal government to relinquish its grip. By eradicating the Church's authority over state affairs, we pave the way for a sovereign Italy, free from foreign domination and reactionary forces, allowing the spirit of unity to flourish among our people."

  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_8: "The Turin Treaty"
  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_8_desc: "In 1860, the Treaty of Turin marked a crucial moment in the history of Italian unification. Signed between the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and France, this agreement sanctioned the transfer of sovereignty over Nice and Savoy. In return, France committed to supporting Piedmont's expansion against the Austrians. This strategic alliance was vital for strengthening Piedmont as a military and political power. The act not only consolidated France's role as a key player in the unification process but also laid the groundwork for a new united Italy, freeing the country from centuries of territorial divisions."

  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_9: "War with the Papal States"
  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_9_desc: "The invasion of the Papal States by the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont marked a pivotal turning point in Italian unification. As the Franco-Prussian War weakened French support for the Pope, the Italian government seized the opportunity to assert its claim over Rome. The Italian army advanced, facing little resistance from the Papal forces. This bold move aimed to integrate Rome into the newly unified Italy, fulfilling the long-held aspiration of Italian nationalists. The capture of Rome not only symbolized the end of the Papal temporal power but also solidified Italy’s status as a unified nation, with Rome declared its capital, thus completing a significant chapter in the nation’s history."

  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_10: "War of the Kaiser"
  je_risorgimento_sardinia_path_button_event_10_desc: "The conquest of Lombardy-Venetia by the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont marked a significant milestone in Italian unification. Following an alliance with France, Victor Emmanuel II and Prime Minister Cavour launched the Second War of Independence against Austrian control over the region. Key victories at Magenta and Solferino forced Austria to cede Lombardy, while Venetia remained under Austrian rule. This success energized the Italian nationalist movement and demonstrated Sardinia’s growing influence in the peninsula. In 1866, Italy joined forces with Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. Though Italian forces faced defeats, Prussia’s victory pressured Austria to relinquish Venetia to Italy."

  great_revision_italian_unification.6.f: "In 1860, just before the capture of Naples, Giuseppe Garibaldi and his forces were advancing rapidly through Southern Italy after a series of victories against the Bourbon army. As Garibaldi approached Naples, tension in the city grew. King Francis II, realizing his forces were weakening, fled the capital for Gaeta, leaving Naples vulnerable. The city's defenses were in disarray, and its population was divided between loyalty to the Bourbons and support for unification.

Garibaldi triumphantly entered into Naples on September 7, 1860, and was greeted by the people as a liberator.
